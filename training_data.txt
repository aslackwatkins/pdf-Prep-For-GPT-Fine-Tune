Rationale:  The ever growing gap between the wealthy and the poor in Canada will lead to social unrest, increased crime rates and violence.  Research indicates that a guaranteed basic income can reduce this gap, and create social security while being cost neutral. Savings in health, justice, education and social welfare as well as the building of self-reliant, taxpaying citizens more than offset the investment. Mincome was an experimental basic income project that occurred in Dauphin, Manitoba during the 1970s. The project, funded jointly by the Manitoba provincial government and the Canadian federal government, began with a news release on February 22, 1974, and was closed down in 1979. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether a guaranteed, unconditional annual income caused disincentive to work for the recipients, and how great such a disincentive would be.  A final report was never issued, but Dr. Evelyn Forget conducted an analysis of the program in 2009 which was published in 2011.

Lake Winnipeg and the Lake Winnipeg Watershed  Background:  As noted in the Report of the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development (fall 2010) \u201cthe federal and provincial governments share responsibility for fresh water management. The provinces have authority to legislate with respect to various aspects of water supply and use, pollution control, hydroelectric and non-nuclear power development, irrigation and recreation within their borders. The federal government has jurisdiction over aspects of fresh water regulation, including fisheries, navigation, boundary and trans-boundary waters shared with the United States and federal lands\u201d.  The Report stated that \u201cSection 44 of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999 requires the federal Minister of the Environment to establish, operate, and maintain a system for monitoring environmental quality. According to the Act, environment means the components of the earth and includes water, while the definition of environmental quality includes the health of ecosystems. Section 5 of the Canada Water Act empowers the Minister of the Environment to enter into intergovernmental arrangements to: \u2022 establish and maintain an inventory of any waters where there is a significant national interest in the management of such water resources (such as Lake Winnipeg); and  \u2022 collect, process, and provide data on the quality, quantity, distribution, and use of those waters.\u201d   The excessive nutrient (primarily phosphorus and nitrogen) loading of Lake Winnipeg from point and nonpoint pollution sources is of primary concern. The excessive nutrients are responsible for the growth of blue-green algae that produce harmful toxins, out competes beneficial algae, and can cause hypoxic or anoxic conditions (low or no dissolved oxygen levels) when large mats die and decompose. It has been estimated that half of the nutrient load originates from within Manitoba borders. Agriculture, industry, and municipal waste management practices all influence the nutrient loading of Lake Winnipeg.   The Lake Winnipeg Basin Initiative (LWBI), a four-year project, has been developed in response to the shared responsibilities of the Province of Manitoba and Federal Ministry of the Environment. The Initiative is currently in year three, and yet there has been no commitment by the federal government to fund it past the four-year period.     The primary focus of the LWBI is focused on six key science objectives to be achieved over the four-year period of time. In addition, the LWBI supports trans-boundary watershed governance and community stewardship efforts.  The LWBI has received $17.7 million in funding. The majority of the funding, $12.1 million is being dedicated to the scientific objectives of the plan; portions of which encompass activities that should be carried out by Environment Canada. In addition, the boundary/trans-boundary (International Boundary Water Treaty Act) is an ongoing responsibility of Environment Canada and its funding of $1.9 million is being categorized as a cost of the LWBI.   The Community Stewardship program portion of the LWBI is being funded at $3.7 million over the four-year period.   The Liberal Party of Canada, while still in government, committed $120 million in federal funding to cleanup of Lake Winnipeg. The funding was to be allocated over a 10-year period of time.   "}

Policy Recommendation:  It is recommended that the Liberal Party of Canada, in general, supports the continuation and extension of the Lake Winnipeg Basin Initiative, and more specifically increase funding as it pertains to the Community Stewardship fund for nonpoint source pollution projects. It is further recommended that the Liberal Party of Canada support municipal infrastructure (wastewater treatment) and other point source pollution projects that would assist in the remediation of Lake Winnipeg by 2020.  It is recommended that the Liberal Party of Canada supports increases to project and staff budgetary levels to ensure that Environment Canada has the capacity to carry out its regulatory and fiduciary responsibilities as it pertains to Lake Winnipeg and the Lake Winnipeg watershed and the goal of remediation of Lake Winnipeg by 2020.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- What is point and nonpoint source pollution? The term \"point source\" means any discernible, confined and discrete conveyance, including but not limited to any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel, conduit, well, discrete fissure, container, rolling stock, concentrated animal feeding operation, or vessel or other floating craft, from which pollutants are or may be discharged. This term does not include agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture. Nonpoint source pollution generally results from land runoff, precipitation, atmospheric deposition, drainage, seepage or hydrologic modification. Unlike pollution from industrial and sewage treatment plants, nonpoint source (NPS) pollution comes from many diffuse sources. NPS pollution is caused by rainfall or snowmelt moving over and through the ground. As the runoff moves, it picks up and carries away natural and human-made pollutants, finally depositing them into lakes, rivers, wetlands, coastal waters and ground waters. The federal government, in 2008, committed $30 million to clean up similar problems in Lake Simcoe, a lake with a surface area of 744 km2 vs. Lake Winnipeg with a surface area of 24,514 km2.

The projection of $100 billion of federal financial flexibility to the end of the decade existed to further reduce debt, decrease income taxes, to invest in social programs and provide financial capabilities for unexpected events or natural catastrophes.  In May 2006, the budget figures indicated that there would have been a $17.4 billion surplus if the Conservatives had not intervened.  In 2006, the Conservative government reduced the GST to 6%, while spending has increased by $40 billion in just over 2 years.  Presently, Canada\u2019s debt has increased by $56 billion making Mr. Harper the \u201cbiggest\u201d spending Prime Minister in Canada\u2019s history.

The Infrastructure Deficit  Background:  The infrastructure supporting essential services in Canadian cities and communities is aging.  Local governments\u2019 ability to maintain or repair this infrastructure is becoming increasing difficult because of the dramatic increase in costs.  The infrastructure deficits grow larger each year. Winnipeg, being only one of those cities, is currently facing a $3B infrastructure deficit.  Infrastructure Canada\u2019s program Building Canada \u2013 Modern Infrastructure for a Strong Canada is inadequate to tackle the enormity of the crisis being faced by the majority of Canadian cities, towns and smaller communities. Failing to take immediate action will only result in an expediential increase in the infrastructure deficit, a burden for future generations.  Required Action:  Canada\u2019s federal government has to recognize the growing infrastructure deficit that exists in Canadian communities and take appropriate action to revamp and properly fund federal programs to be more effective, predictable and financially feasible in the future.  Policy Recommendation:  It is recommended that the Liberal Party of Canada: \u2022 Develop a funding strategy to deal with the infrastructure deficit that Canadian communities are facing; and \u2022 Collaborate with municipal governments and local governments to revise the infrastructure programs.

This investment will be funded by cancelling the poorly targeted education and textbook tax credits. The tuition tax credit will be maintained.This will increase the level of non-repayable grant assistance to students by $750 million per year, rising to $850 million per year by 2019/20.

We will invest in public transit to shorten commute times, cut air pollution, strengthen our communities, and grow our economy. Canadian cities have been growing at a rapid rate, but investment in public transit has not kept pace.  Stephen Harper\u2019s failure to invest has led to worsening traffic congestion, making it harder for families to spend time together. This gridlock also costs our economy billions of dollars in lost productivity each year. We will get our communities moving again, by giving our provinces, territories, and municipalities the long-term, predictable federal funding they need to make transit plans a reality.Over the next decade, we will quadruple federal investment in public transit, investing almost $20 billion more in transit infrastructure.In communities all across Canada, transit projects are ready to go.In British Columbia\u2019s Lower Mainland, for example, plans are in place to:\u2022 increase SeaBus service to every ten minutes during morning and afternoon rushes;\u2022 extend rapid transit service along Broadway, currently the busiest bus corridor in North America; and\u2022 bring light rail transit to Surrey, one of the fastest growing parts of the region.We will work with provinces and municipalities across the country to get projects like these done.

With a federal partner at the table, stories like the revitalization of Alexandra Park can happen in communities all across Canada. We will invest in sustainable infrastructure that makes our communities safer and more resilient.Responsible governments do not walk away from challenges, or pretend they do not exist. We will protect our communities from the challenges of climate change and grow our economy by making significant new investments in green infrastructure.This includes investments in local water and wastewater facilities; clean energy; climate resilient infrastructure, including flood mitigation systems; and infrastructure to protect against changing weather.

As the number of violent conflicts in the world escalates, demand for international peace operations has never been greater.Peace operations are important not only because of the help they provide to millions of people affected by conflicts, but also because they serve Canada\u2019s interests.

Finally, to better help those affected by war and violent conflict, we will contribute more to the United Nations\u2019 mediation, conflict-prevention, and post-conflict reconstruction efforts. We will maintain current National Defence spending levels, including current planned increases.Under Stephen Harper, investments in the Canadian Armed Forces have been erratic, promised increases in funding have been scaled back, and more than $10 billion of approved funding was left unspent. This mismanagement has left Canada\u2019s Armed Forces underfunded and ill-equipped, and the courageous members of the Forces unsupported after years of dedicated service.We will not let Canada\u2019s Armed Forces be shortchanged, and we will not lapse military spending from year to year.

This reflects a CCB that invests $21.7 billion in 2016/17, the savings from cancelling income splitting ($2.0 billion), and replacing the CCTB, NCBS, and UCCB ($17.9 billion).CCB cost projections are based on the number of children under 18 by family income (CANSIM Table 111-0013, Table 111-0022) applied against the CCB\u2019s new benefit levels. Cost projections were compared and confirmed with Statistics Canada\u2019s Social Policy Simulation Database and Model (SPSD/M). To project future years, the aver-age growth rate for child benefits in recent years was used, based on historical data from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and the Public Accounts.After the announcement of the Liberal CCB, the Conservatives claimed that Liberals had not accounted for fed-eral revenue from the taxable UCCB. This was proven false. As part of that claim, the Conservatives released previously unavailable and more detailed Department of Finance data on CCTB/NCBS cost projections, which showed a reduction in the costs of child benefits in 2014/15.If there are lower child benefit costs, then the cost of both existing benefits and the new CCB will be reduced. In fact, using those revised projected child population growth rates would reduce the net cost of the CCB below the $1.8 billion that we have estimated. We will, therefore, continue to use our higher starting projections to ensure the most prudent figure possible.Backgrounder \u2013 Real Change: Fairness for the middle class"}

It is important that the federal government is persistently committed to ensuring federal expenditures are fair for Canadians, efficient, and fiscally responsible. In 2005, then-Prime Minister Paul Martin tasked  National Revenue Minister John McCallum with a government-wide expenditure review, which resulted in $3 billion in booked annual savings within four years.1We will meet this same target within four years, which in 2019/20 would represent significantly less than one per-cent of total federal fiscal and tax expenditure spending. Today\u2019s challenges are different than those in 2005, and our priorities reflect the changes that are needed after ten years of Harper\u2019s Conservative government. These include:\u2022 Significantly reducing the advertising budget of the government of Canada, and ending the use of government advertising for partisan activities.\u2022 Conducting an overdue and wide-ranging review of the over $100 billion in increasingly complex tax expenditures that now exist, with the core objective being to look for opportunities to reduce tax benefits that unfairly help those with individual incomes in excess of $200,000 per year. For example, a recent Parliamentary Budget Officer analysis of tax expenditure changes from 2005 to 2013 demonstrates that multiple new measures introduced by Stephen Harper provided new benefits to tax filers in the 96th to 100th percentiles. \u2022 A starting point would be to set a cap on how much can be claimed through the stock option deduction. The Department of Finance estimates that 8,000 very high-income Canadians deduct an average of $400,000 from their taxable incomes via stock options. This represents three quarters of the fiscal impact of this deduction, which in total cost $750 million in 2014. Stock options are a useful compensation tool for start-up companies, and we would ensure that employees with up to $100,000 in annual stock option gains will be unaffected by any new cap. \u2022 Directing CRA to immediately begin an analysis and stronger enforcement of tax evasion, or what the OECD calls the \u201ctax gap.\u201d According to a 2013 analysis by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, the size of the gap totals nearly 7 percent of total tax liability in the United Kingdom and 14.5 percent in the United States. Harper\u2019s Conservative government refused to provide the PBO with the data that is needed to undertake a similar analysis for Canada.\u2022 As we reduce the small business tax rate to 9 percent from 11 percent, we will ensure that Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation (CCPC) status is not used to reduce personal income tax obligations for high-income earners rather than supporting small businesses. Michael Wolfson from the University of Ottawa estimates that approximately $500 million per year is lost, particularly as high-income individuals use CCPC status as an income splitting tool.\u2022 Reducing the use of external consultants, bringing expenditures closer to 2005/06 levels.

With inflation, that estimate increases to approximately $3.4 billion by 2016/17. High earners may attempt to use tax planning strategies to avoid higher taxes. We will increase enforcement resources for the CRA to ensure tax liabil-ities are collected. However, we have also included a prudence factor of $600 million in our estimates. We project revenue of $2.8 billion in 2016/17, rising to $3.0 billion in 2019/20.  Cancel the education and textbook tax credits to boost student grantsThe current system of post-secondary education tax credits includes the modest textbook and education tax credits, which only provide a benefit at the end of the tax year, and are not targeted at students from low- and middle-income families. We will eliminate these two credits in order to boost upfront non-repayable grants that put money directly into the pockets of students, and to ensure our student loan system is more flexible. The cur-rent tuition tax credit will remain in place. Revenue projections are derived from the Department of Finance tax expenditures report, with a four year window for usage of outstanding carried forward credits.Continue to phase out fossil fuel subsidiesWe will fulfill Canada\u2019s G20 commitment to phase out subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. In 2014, the Pembina Institute estimated that more than $1 billion in fossil fuel subsidies still existed in our current tax framework. We will direct the Department of Finance to conduct a detailed analysis of fossil fuel subsidies. A target of $250 mil-lion in reduced fossil fuel subsidies is our starting point, and a first step will be to allow for the use of the Canadian Exploration Expenses tax deduction only in cases of unsuccessful exploration."}

We will move forward with a real plan to make life  more affordable for Canadians \u2013 especially the middle class and people who  are working hard to join it. More Money, Tax FreeWe will help Canadians keep more of  what they earn.Four years ago, we gave Canadians the tax break they deserve \u2013 putting hundreds of dollars back into the pockets of the middle class by cutting their taxes and asking the wealthiest one per cent of Canadians to pay a little more.We invested in Canadians over these past four years, and in turn they invested in their communi-ties \u2013 creating more than a million new jobs, and driving Canada\u2019s unemploy-ment and poverty  rates to record lows.To move forward with more help for the middle class and people working hard to join it, we will make sure that people don\u2019t pay federal taxes on the first $15,000 they earn. This will save the average family nearly $600 a year. It will also mean that about 700,000 more Canadians, including seniors and young people starting their careers, will pay no federal tax at all, lifting nearly 40,000 more people out of poverty.While Andrew Scheer\u2019s tax plan would give more to wealthy Canadians, our plan lowers taxes the most for people who make less, helps the middle class, and ensures that the wealthy don\u2019t get an extra hand up. Our tax cut would also help lift twice as many Canadians out of poverty than the Conservative plan would.A Place to Call Home We will make it easier for more people to buy their first home.For many young people starting their careers, saving up enough to make a down payment on a home is a far-off dream \u2013 and for ten years, Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservatives did nothing to address this growing problem. $600per yearaverage family savings"}

This will be especially helpful for women, who typically carry more family responsibilities, and will mean that every single Canadian parent will be able to afford to spend the first year at home with their child, when it matters most.Residents of Quebec will receive a comparable benefit for the portion of federal taxes they pay as part of the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan, and we will ensure that Guaranteed Paid Family Leave is integrated effectively with Quebec\u2019s provincial parental benefits system, which the province will continue to run itself.More Accessible and Affordable Child CareWe will make before and  after school child care more accessible and affordable  for families.Parents work hard to support their families and give their kids a good start in life, but as working parents know, the need for good, affordable child care doesn\u2019t stop when a child goes to school. For many families, before  and after school are can be difficult to find and expensive to use. This is especially true for parents who work irregular hours due to things like over-time, late shifts, or multiple jobs. Andrew Scheer\u2019s idea of helping families is to give tax cuts to those who attend private schools. Canadian families need high quality, affordable child care solutions, not tax breaks for the wealthy at everyone else\u2019s expense.We\u2019ve already created tens of thousands of new pre-school child care spaces, and will move forward with creating up to 250,000 more before and after school spaces for kids under 10, with at least 10 per cent of these new spaces set aside for care during extended hours.To help families with the high cost of care, we will also lower child care fees for before and after school programs by 10 per cent across the board. More than a million families will benefit from these lower fees. For an Ontario family of four with two kids, it will mean about $800 back in their pockets, every year.We will also move forward with more support for our early childhood educators, to ensure that across the country, they are better paid and trained to take care of our kids. This means lower tuition costs for people getting their early childhood educator degree, and extra help to cover the costs for early childhood educators seeking further training. 250kspacesbefore and after school careup to"}

An Affordable EducationWe will continue to help students afford college  and university.These days, getting a degree or diploma isn\u2019t a luxury \u2013 it\u2019s a must-have for many good, well paying jobs. Because post-secondary education was unaffordable for many, we took action \u2013 increasing Canada Student Grants, reducing interest costs on Canada Student Loans, improving the repayment assistance program, and giving more help to adult students and people receiving EI.Still, the costs of rent, books, and groceries \u2013  along with cuts to student aid by provincial Conservative governments \u2013 are putting an immense amount of financial pressure and stress on students. To help more students prepare for good jobs while taking on less debt, we will move forward with more generous Canada Student Grants and more affordable and flexible student loans. We will give full- and part-time students up to $1,200 more per year, through increased Canada Student Grants, and will give students two years after graduation to get started in their career before they need to begin paying off their student loans, interest-free. We will also change the rules so that graduates won\u2019t have to start repaying their loans until they make at least $35,000, and if their income ever falls below this level, their payments will be put on hold. To make it easier for parents to focus on their families rather than their debt, we will allow new parents to pause their student loan repayments, interest-free, until their youngest child reaches the age of five. New parents who have graduated but haven\u2019t yet finished paying off their student loans will also get to hit pause until their child turns five.Additional compensation will be offered to prov-inces and territories that do not participate in the Canada Student Loan Program.Cell Phone BillsWe will help cut the cost of cell and wireless services by 25 per cent.As Canadians, we pay some of the highest prices in the world for cell phone services, while Canadian telecom companies are among the most profitable in the developed world. To help lower monthly cell phone bills and bring costs in line with what people pay in other coun-tries, we will move forward with cutting the cost of these services by 25 per cent in the next two years by using the government\u2019s regulatory powers, saving an average middle class family of four nearly $1,000 per year. Travel for NorthernersWe will make life more affordable for people living in Canada\u2019s North. Whether for school, medical appointments, or to visit with family, people who call Canada\u2019s North home need to travel \u2013 but the high cost of airfare can make it unaffordable for many. The current Northern Residents Deduction only allows people who already receive travel benefits through work to deduct travel costs, with no help for people whose work doesn\u2019t help cover those costs.To make travel more affordable for everyone in the North, we will move forward with improvements to the Northern Resident Deduction, giving people living in the Northern Zone at least $1,200 in de-ductible travel costs, with $600 in deductible travel costs for people in the Intermediate Zone. To make sure that these savings are not simply passed on to airlines and other transportation  companies, we will direct the Competition Bureau to oversee the pricing of transportation in the North, and will review the communities covered by these zones to ensure that Northerners in all parts of the country get the help they need to make  life affordable."}

When people unexpectedly find themselves out of work because of a business closure, they shouldn\u2019t struggle to get the support they need.To help workers transition to a new job following the loss of long-term work, we will move forward with a Career Insurance Benefit. This benefit will be available to people who have worked continuously for the same employer for five or more years and are laid off when the business closes.The Career Insurance Benefit will kick in after Employment Insurance ends, providing an addition-al 20 per cent of insured earnings in the first year following the layoff, and an extra 10 per cent in the second year.

Better Working ConditionsWe will strengthen employment benefits and make Canada an even better place to work.In the last four years, we have helped make work more flexible and secure for more people, but many workers still struggle to live a balanced life. For some people, this means missing out on important family events because they have to work late or be con-stantly available online; for others, it means suffering in silence because they are afraid to talk about the mental health challenges they are facing at work. People deserve better. To help make life less stressful and to give people more time to do the things they love, we will  move forward with new federal labour code  protections, including: \u0092an extra day to spend with family and friends, through a new federal Family Day holiday;  \u0092a federal minimum wage of $15 per hour, starting in 2020 and rising with inflation, with provisions to ensure that where provincial or territorial minimum wages are higher, that wage will prevail; \u0092better support for the mental health of workers, by including mental health as a specific element of occupational health and safety, and requiring employers to take preventative steps to address workplace stress and injury; \u0092greater labour protections for people who work through digital platforms; these are often contract or freelance workers (such as drivers for ride-sharing companies) whose status isn\u2019t clearly covered by provincial or federal laws, so we will give them greater protection by develop-ing relevant federal rules for this growing area of the economy; and \u0092new provisions, to be developed with employers and labour groups, that give workers the \u201cright to disconnect.\u201d  This will preserve workers\u2019 ability to work overtime, while giving people the right to request that they not work extra hours. To help workers who fall ill and need help to pay the bills while they rest and recover \u2013 such as those recovering from cancer treatments \u2013 we will also move forward with extending Employment Insurance sickness benefits from 15 weeks  to 26 weeks.Guaranteed Training for Apprentices We will help Red Seal apprentices get the work experience they need to finish their certification  and find good, well-paying jobs.People in the skilled trades are a vital part of our economy \u2013 helping to build our homes, feed our families, and keep our communities powered and moving \u2013 but too often, apprentices miss out on good jobs because they can\u2019t get the job experience they need to complete their training on time.Today, only one out of five Red Seal apprentices is able to complete their certification on time, with the lack of stable jobs cited as the most common reason. This is true even for trades where workers typically earn more than $100,000 per year. To give apprentices more certainty and more op-portunities to gain work experience, we will move forward with creating the Canadian Apprenticeship Service, in partnership with provinces, territories, employers, and unions. With this new help, appren-tices who enter the Red Seal trades can be more confident about the future, knowing that jobs will be available when they need them. To support this effort, we will work with our  partners to create more opportunities, providing up to $10,000 per apprentice, over four years, for every new position created.

Help for Workers in Seasonal Industries We will make permanent changes to Employment Insurance, to give workers in seasonal industries more reliable support between jobs.Industries like tourism and fish processing are an important source of jobs in many communities, but  their seasonal nature means that people are often without work for months at a time, through no  fault of their own. To give these workers more security and support, especially when Employment Insurance is disrupted because of changing labour market conditions outside of their control, we will move forward with improvements to a recent pilot project that has given extra help to tens of thousands of workers in seasonal industries.Once this pilot concludes, we will introduce a permanent program to give these workers more consistent and reliable benefits \u2013 making it easier for them to support themselves and their families between work seasons.We will also work with Statistics Canada to strengthen local labour market data, so that Employment Insurance can better reflect local labour market realities, especially in large and diverse regions. More Accessible Workplaces  and SchoolsWe will make it easier for people with disabilities to work or attend school.Across Canada, nearly 650,000 people with disabili-ties have the potential to work or attend school,  but aren\u2019t able to do so because they don\u2019t have access to the accommodations that would make  this possible. To help more people with disabilities go to school, enter the workforce, and join the middle class, we will move forward with a new $40 million per year national workplace accessibility fund, with a special focus on making small and medium-sized business-es more accessible.

Public Health Care We will strengthen health care and make sure all Canadians get the high-quality care they deserve.For more than a decade, Conservative inaction put the future of our public health care system at risk. We reversed that worrisome trend, moving forward with new health accords, investing billions more, and making sure that home care and mental health services have the funding they need to make a real difference in people\u2019s lives. We will continue to collaborate with the provinces and territories to move forward with more acces-sible care, shorter wait times, and better health outcomes, and we will:  \u0092make sure that every Canadian has access to a family doctor or primary health care team, improving the quality of care for the nearly five million Canadians who today lack access; \u0092set clear national standards for access to mental health services so Canadians can get the sup-port they need quickly, when they need it most; \u0092continue to make home care and palliative care more available across the country; and \u0092take the critical next steps to implement  national universal pharmacare so that all Canadians have the drug coverage they  need at an affordable price.We will back up these commitments with an additional commitment of $6 billion over the next four years, tied to outcomes and negotiated with the provinces and territories.Child Disability Benefit We will double support to parents who care for special needs kids.Parents who care for their special needs children go the extra mile every day.

Young people understand this \u2013 that\u2019s why they are marching in the streets, demanding action. We can\u2019t afford to go back to the Harper years when the Conservatives did nothing about climate change. We need to take our lead from young people  and step up our fight against climate change. And we need to do it now.A Net-Zero Emissions FutureWe will achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.When it comes to fighting climate change, one thing is clear: doing less costs people more. The best way through the climate emergency we are all facing is forward \u2013 toward a net-zero  emissions future. Net-zero emissions \u2013 where there are no carbon emissions, or where emissions are completely off-set by other actions that remove carbon from the atmosphere, such as planting trees \u2013 are essential to keeping the world our children and grandchil-dren grow up in safe and liveable.To help achieve this goal by 2050, we will:\u2022 set legally-binding, five-year milestones, based on the advice of the experts and consultations with Canadians, to reach net-zero emissions;\u2022 appoint a group of scientists, economists,  and experts to recommend the best path to  get to net-zero;\u2022 exceed Canada\u2019s 2030 emissions goal by intro-ducing new carbon reducing measures; and\u2022 ensure energy workers and communities can shape their own futures by introducing a Just Transition Act, giving workers access to the training, support, and new opportunities needed to succeed in the clean economy.A Price On Pollution And A Real  Climate PlanWe will continue to lead with a price on pollution and a plan to help reduce emissions.Climate change is already having a serious and irreversible effect on people, on our communities, and on our economy.

We put a price on pollution to help reduce emissions, and introduced a new rebate system that puts more money back in the pockets of Canadians.We will build on our national climate plan with new measures to help move Canada toward a net-zero emissions future, including strengthening existing rules to cut emissions from Canada\u2019s biggest polluters, including oil and gas.Natural Climate SolutionsWe will plant two billion trees to clean our air and protect our communities.Canada\u2019s vast forests, grass-lands, and wetlands  help clean our air, safeguard our water, and provide a home to wildlife. But just as nature is under threat from climate change, it can also be a critical ally in the fight against it. Natural climate solutions like planting trees and protecting grasslands can help us get closer to reaching our targets for lower emissions.To better support healthy ecosystems that help fight climate change, we will move forward with an ambitious plan to plant two billion trees over 10 years. This will help create about 3,500 seasonal jobs in tree planting each year, and will be part of a $3 billion commitment to better conserve and restore forests, grasslands, agricultural lands, wetlands, and coastal areas. As part of this commitment, we will also help cities expand and diversify their urban forests, will invest to protect Canada\u2019s trees from infestations, and will help rebuild our forests after a wildfire. The New Climate Reality We will help people and communities deal with the realities of increased climate-related risks  and disasters.Canadians know all too well that a changing climate comes with real risks to our safety, to our homes, and to our ability to make ends meet. To help people get ready for climate risks and realities, we will move forward with programs that help protect against some of the worst effects of climate change. We will:\u2022 protect homeowners who are at high risk of flooding and don\u2019t have adequate insurance protection, by creating a low-cost national flood insurance program;\u2022 help Canadians better understand the risks they face when they buy a home, by working with provinces and territories to complete all flood maps in Canada; and\u2022 develop a national action plan to assist home-owners with potential relocation for those at the highest risk of repeat flooding.Disaster ResponseWe will make sure that people get the help they need when there is a federally declared disaster  or emergency. The cost of climate change is undeniable. In Canada, we\u2019ve paid out more in the last six years in response to floods and wildfires than we have in the past 40 years combined \u2013 and that doesn\u2019t include the financial and emotional toll that disas-ters take on people, when crops go unplanted and homes are destroyed.To help people whose jobs and livelihoods are affected when disaster strikes, we will move for-ward with a new Employment Insurance Disaster Assistance Benefit, to be developed in consultation with experts, workers, and employers. This new benefit will launch in 2021 and will help replace the income that is lost when families need to temporar-ily stop working to protect their homes, or because they need to relocate to safety.Building on the $2 billion we have already invested in helping communities prepare for and prevent weather related disasters like floods and fires, we will move forward with an additional $1 billion investment over the next decade in the Disaster Mitigation and Adaptation Fund, so communities have a proactive, permanent and sustainable way to address the emerging threats of climate change.twobilliontreesplanted to clean our air"}

Zero-emission vehicles are a good solution \u2013 provided  we have the right kind of infrastructure to  support them.To make using zero-emission vehicles easier, we will move forward \u2013 in partnership with industry and communities \u2013 to install up to 5,000 charging stations along the Trans Canada Highway and other major road networks, and in Canada\u2019s urban and rural areas. Northern communities, as well as apartments and condominiums, will also be includ-ed \u2013 connecting people and communities from coast to coast to coast. As more and more people buy zero-emission vehicles, there will be a growing market of used vehicles for sale. To make buying a used zero-emission vehicle more affordable, we will expand the incentive that already exists for buying new  zero-emission cars. This will provide a 10 per cent rebate on a used zero-emission vehicle up to a maximum value  of $2,000. To help communities transition to using more zero-emission vehicles, we will require that new federal investments in public transit are used to support zero-emission buses and rail systems starting in 2023, and will work with municipalities to address any exceptional circumstances.Working in partnership with the provinces and territories, we will also move forward with a new fund to help more school boards and municipalities purchase 5,000 zero-emissions school and transit buses over the next five years.

To better coordinate efforts to prosecute terror suspects to the fullest extent of the law, we will move forward with the creation of a Director of Terrorism Prosecutions. This new office will make sure that Canadians who travel abroad to join ter-rorist organizations, or who participate in terrorist organizations here at home, are brought to justice. We will also move forward with more support for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, so that they can hire and train 100 additional officers for offices and embassies abroad. This will improve our ability to combat terrorism, human trafficking, drug smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of organized crime.We will also move forward with reintroducing legislation to create a review body for the  Canada Border Services Agency \u2013 the only  remaining security agency that does not have  its own independent review.Drug Use and AddictionWe will make it easier for people to get the help they need, with better access to treatment.Thousands of people in Canada die from overdoses related to drug use. Last year, more than 4,400 of those deaths were from opioid use alone, and methamphetamine addiction is also on the rise. The opioid crisis is the greatest public health emer-gency since the AIDS epidemic, and could lead to a decrease in Canadians\u2019 life expectancies for the first time in modern history.225morejudgesto improve access to justice"}

We will also make drug treatment court the default option for first-time non-violent offenders charged exclusively with simple possession, to help drug users get quick access to treatment, and to prevent more serious crimes.Elder AbuseWe will help protect our seniors from abuse.Every year, about one in ten seniors is a victim of crime, but many seniors are reluctant to report it \u2013 with only half of violent crimes against seniors reported to police, and only about a third of finan-cial crimes being reported.To help combat elder abuse and better protect victims, we will move forward with a national defi-nition of elder abuse, invest in better data collection and law enforcement, and establish new penalties in the Criminal Code relating to elder abuse. First RespondersWe will take care of the people who  take care of us. Our firefighters, police officers, and paramedics put their own safety on the line every day in service to all Canadians, at great personal expense. We will continue to support our first responders and public safety workers by recommitting to advanc-ing Canada\u2019s first-ever National Action Plan on post-traumatic stress injuries.In recognition of this unique service, we created the Memorial Grant Program for First Responders, which provides a lump-sum, tax-free payment of up to $300,000 to family members of first responders who have died as a result of their duties.We will expand the Memorial Grant Program to include correctional workers by the end of 2020, and will continue to consult with other public  safety workers to further broaden the program  as appropriate.People who work in Canada\u2019s correctional system also play a critical role in protecting the public, doing difficult work in a uniquely challenging and often dangerous environment. Thankfully, work-re-lated deaths are rare for these employees, but when they happen, we need to be there to support the families they leave behind. Privacy and Data ProtectionWe will protect consumers\u2019 rights online,  and bring forward new regulations for large  digital companies. Today, a limited number of very large companies hold an extraordinary amount of personal data about Canadians. This can help to make things like online shopping and connecting with family and friends easier and more convenient, but the lack of regulation for online platforms like Facebook and Google \u2013 as well as companies that possess large amounts of data, like banks and credit card compa-nies \u2013 also means that people have less control over their own personal information. To make sure that people can exercise more control over their online lives and the use of their personal data, we will move forward with Canada\u2019s Digital Charter. Overseen and enforced by a more power-ful Privacy Commissioner, the Charter will establish a new set of online rights, to help people feel more confident about and in control of their personal data, including the right to:\u2022 data portability, so that people can take  their data from platform to platform;\u2022 withdraw, remove, and erase basic personal data from a platform;\u2022 know how personal data is being used, including knowing who has access to it, supported by a national advertising registry where companies would have to report with whom your data is being shared or sold, with the ability to withdraw consent at any time; \u2022 review and challenge the amount of  personal data that a company or government  has collected;\u2022 data security, compelling those who use per-sonal data to take proactive steps to adequately protect it;"}

But today, only about 10 per cent of veterans who need mental health support get the help they need from Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC). That\u2019s not acceptable. To ensure that our veterans have access to high-quality mental health care when and where they need it, we will move forward with a new rapid-response service staffed by social workers, case management counsellors, and peer support workers. We will proactively reach out to every Canadian veteran to make sure that they know about the help available, and how to access it.Disability Benefits We will make it easier for veterans to get  disability benefits. No veteran should ever have to suffer in silence. To help ease the stigma that many may feel about starting a disability claim, and to make sure that every veteran gets the help they need, we will give our veterans up to $3,000 in free counselling services before a disability claim is required. This will give veterans in need of help nearly six months of free support, provided directly by VAC or one if its service partners, and will help as many as 20,000 veterans each year. And to simplify and shorten the process, we will move forward with automatic approval for the most common disability applications, including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and arthritis, among others.

This may mean a promotion or a chance to try new things \u2013 but it can also be a time of tremendous stress as families adapt to new routines and partners look for  new work.To help family members more easily adjust to their new homes, we will move forward with a national employment and training support service.

At a time when intolerance and hate is on the rise around the world, we will recommit to being a place where everyone matters, and where no one is left behind. A Renewed Commitment to Equality We will renew our commitment to reaching full gender equality.The federal government made a commitment to considering the gender impacts of its decisions more than two decades ago, dating back to the 1995 World Conference on Women \u2013 Conservative governments failed to live up to that promise. Because public policies affect women and men in different ways, we made gender budgeting and Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) a permanent part of the federal budget-making process. We will continue to move forward with their use, and in recognition of the Conference\u2019s 25th anniversary next year will: \u2022 renew our commitment to a Federal Plan for Gender Equality, including a coordinated strate-gy built on the Gender Results Framework and other international agreements; and\u2022 ensure that rigorous GBA+ continue to be performed on all policy proposals.Diversity in LeadershipWe will continue to build a government  as diverse as Canada.Government makes better decisions \u2013 and Canadians are better served \u2013 when the people making decisions reflect Canada\u2019s diversity.

In the last four years, we\u2019ve made a difference with investments to prevent gender-based violence, stronger supports for survivors, and a more respon-sive justice system. Still, not everyone is able to get the help they need when they need it the most. To help protect more people and bring an  end to gender-based violence, we will build on  the foundation we laid with the Gender-Based Violence Strategy and move forward with an additional $30 million investment to develop a National Action Plan. This will help ensure that anyone facing gender-based violence has reliable and timely access to protection and services, no matter who they are or where they live. Sexual and Reproductive HealthWe will protect a woman\u2019s right to make decisions about her body, and make family planning and sexual and reproductive health care more  accessible and affordable.We believe that women have the right to make all decisions about their own bodies \u2013 full stop. That is why we will always protect a woman\u2019s right to access an abortion should she make that choice.Meanwhile, Conservative candidates in Canada  are cozying up to organizations that want to take that right away \u2013 and after decades of progress,  the fundamental right for a woman to choose  what she wants to do with her body is being  thrown into question.We won\u2019t take Canada backward to the debates Canadian women have already fought \u2013 and won. Instead, we will move forward and work with provinces and territories to make sure that sexual and reproductive health medications are covered under national pharmacare.Better Health Care for WomenWe will work towards equal treatment in health care for women.Canada\u2019s publicly-funded universal health care system is a source of pride for Canadians \u2013 it  keeps us healthy, cares for us when we are sick, and makes sure that everyone who needs care  gets it, regardless of their ability to pay. At the same time, not everyone receives the same quality of care \u2013 and this is especially true for  women. To deliver better health care for women, we will move forward to find and eliminate the  gaps in the quality of care women receive. We will: \u2022work with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to integrate sex and gender-based analyses, as well as diversity analyses, to ensure research takes diversity factors into account to improve women\u2019s health care; and\u2022create a National Institute for Women\u2019s Health Research, the first of its kind in Canada.

To support this important and life-saving work, we will move forward with additional investments to help more LGBTQ2 organizations hire staff, expand services and reach a greater number of people. This will be supported by an investment of $10 million a year, over three years.LGBTQ2 Support Lines We will make sure that LGBTQ2 people get the mental health support they need.The challenges that LGBTQ2 people face \u2013 from bullying and discrimination to isolation and alien-ation \u2013 are closely linked to their higher rates of mental health challenges, including an increased prevalence of suicide and suicide-related behaviour. To support more LGBTQ2 people in need, earlier this year we launched a pan-Canadian, 24/7 mental health crisis hotline. To ensure that the community continues to be well-served by hotlines and other support services, we will move forward with an additional investment of $2 million a year to continue this work, including support lines that provide sexual education.A Ban on Conversion TherapyWe will amend the Criminal Code to ban the practice of conversion therapy.Conversion therapy is a scientifically discredited practice that targets vulnerable LGBTQ2 Canadians in an attempt to change their sexual orientation or gender identity. There is international consensus in the medical community that conversion therapy is not founded in science and does not work. To ensure that no one is subjected to this practice, we will move forward on our promise to work with provinces and territories to end conversion therapy in Canada, including making amendments to the Criminal Code that will prohibit this harmful and scientifically disproven practice, especially  against minors.An End to the Blood BanWe will end the discriminatory blood  donation ban.In 2015, we promised to end the blood donation ban \u2013 one that is discriminatory to gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. Since then, that lifetime ban was reduced to one year, then down to three months in 2019. But we know there is more  to do.

Addressing racism and discrimination is important to Canadians, because our country\u2019s diversity is a source of strength. At the same time, Canada is not immune to racism. Systemic racism and dis-crimination can affect the way people are hired or promoted, the kinds of service they receive, or how they interact with institutions like schools  and courtrooms.To address systemic discrimination and uncon-scious biases, we introduced the new Anti-Racism Strategy.

We will:\u2022 establish the Canadian Centre for Peace, Order, and Good Government, which will lend exper-tise and help to people seeking to build peace, advance justice, promote human rights and democracy, and deliver good governance; \u2022 provide international institutions like the International Criminal Court, the World Trade Organization, and others, with additional re-sources to better enforce international law;\u2022 introduce a permanent, dedicated refugee stream to provide safe haven for human rights advocates, journalists, and humanitarian workers at risk, with a target of helping resettle as many as 250 people a year;\u2022 take a leadership role in ensuring the ethical  use of new technology, by developing and supporting international protocols to ban  the development and use of fully autonomous weapons systems; and\u2022 build on the Magnitsky sanctions regime we have put in place, by developing a framework to transfer seized assets from those who commit grave human rights abuses to their victims, with appropriate judicial oversight."}

That hasn\u2019t changed. We know that a country can\u2019t cut its way to  prosperity. Cuts don\u2019t help people. Austerity doesn\u2019t grow the economy. And putting the  interests of wealthy people ahead of the middle class is not how you keep a country like Canada  moving forward. We Believe That A Strong Economy Starts With A Strong Middle Class. That\u2019s why one of the first things we did as a government was raise taxes on the wealthiest one percent, so that we could cut taxes for the middle class. And it\u2019s why, in our very first budget, we introduced the Canada Child Benefit \u2013 to help families with the high cost of raising their kids. We Believe In Investing In People And In Our Communities. Not only because it makes good economic sense, but because it\u2019s the right thing to do. Our invest-ments in young people and families are helping to make life more affordable, and giving more of our kids a good start in life. Our investments in seniors are helping more people have a secure and dignified retirement. And our historic investments in infrastructure are helping  to build communities that are better places to  live today, and better prepared for a changing climate tomorrow.We Believe That Everyone Deserves A Real And Fair Chance At Success.In 2015, after years of austerity and cuts, the econ-omy was slowing down \u2013 and people were feeling it. Especially those whose real needs didn\u2019t line up with aggressive plans to eliminate the deficit, like people living in poverty, Indigenous Peoples, women, young people, racialized people, people living with disabilities, members of the LGBTQ2 communities, and our most vulnerable seniors. Because we believe that everyone deserves a real and fair chance at success, we took a different approach, investing in people with a plan that is targeted, measured, and fiscally responsible. What We\u2019ve DeliveredThis plan to invest in people \u2013 combined with Canadians\u2019 hard work \u2013  helped to move our economy forward.Canadians created more than one million new jobs in just four years. Stronger wage growth is helping more Canadians get ahead, but further progress is needed. With an economy that is strong and growing, and with steadily declining debt relative to the size of our economy, Canada now has the best balance sheet in the G7. And together, we\u2019ve helped to lift 900,000 people out of poverty. At the same time, we know that we need to be prepared for whatever challenges come our way. In 2019, there are events taking place around the world that are creating a real sense of global economic uncertainty, and we need to be ready  to respond."}

That puts Canada in an enviable position, especially compared to other G7 countries. Our net debt-to-GDP ratio is less than half of the EU average, and less than a third of where the United States is  right now. That relatively low level of debt is a serious com-petitive advantage. And our government is fully committed to maintaining that advantage in an increasingly volatile and unpredictable world.We Will Continue To Build Confidence In Canada\u2019s Economy, Making Sure That The World Continues To See Us As A Great Place To Invest. Canada has a \u201ctriple A\u201d credit rating from the three most recognized credit rating agencies. Of other countries in the G7, only Germany can boast of a similarly strong record.This strong rating reflects the confidence that rat-ings agencies have in Canada\u2019s economic strength. We will preserve this rating. More importantly, these ratings show what many people already understand: that even though there is more work to be done, our economy is strong  and growing. We Will Continue To Invest In People And In The Things That Give People A Better Quality Of Life.The last four years have shown what can happen when we put people first and invest in the things that make their lives easier: more money for families to help grow the economy, more good jobs and more liveable communities, and 900,000 fewer people living in poverty. While others seek to move our country backward \u2013 balancing the books at all costs, on the backs of hard-working Canadians \u2013 we will move forward with the investments that we know make a  real difference.

Together, we have made a lot of progress. Our Shared ProgressIn the last four years, we have made advancing gen-der equality and diversity a priority. That\u2019s why we invested in sustainable and predictable funding for a range of women\u2019s and equality-seeking organiza-tions. We created the new department for Women and Gender Equality, established a new federal LGBTQ2 secretariat, and prioritized the  use of Gender-based Analysis Plus (GBA+) as a driving force when developing federal policies  and programs.We believe in fairness, including the belief that women deserve equal pay for work of equal value \u2013 which is why we moved forward with proactive pay equity legislation. We also know that women have an essential role to play in building strong companies and creating more good jobs \u2013 so we invested in helping more women entrepreneurs, created more accessible and affordable child care spaces, and moved forward with more flexible parental leave, to make it easier for new moms to go back to work.We moved forward with protections for gender identity and expression in the Canada Human Rights Act \u2013 because it\u2019s important that the laws that govern our country reflect the diversity we see in our communities. Because Indigenous women and girls are dispro-portionately affected by all forms of violence, we moved forward with a National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, accepted the Inquiry\u2019s final report, and committed to co-developing and implementing a distinc-tions-based national action plan to implement the report\u2019s Calls to Justice.We moved forward with landmark investments to counter systemic racism and biases as part of a new national Anti-Racism Strategy, because no one should be denied opportunity or be made to feel unwelcome in Canada because of who they are. Because every person \u2013 regardless of ability \u2013 should be able to fully participate in society, we moved forward with new investments and legisla-tion that marked the most significant advancement in federal disability rights in 30 years.And on the global stage, we are leading the way with a new Feminist International Assistance Policy, making investments in girls\u2019 education and wom-en\u2019s empowerment, and helping to make sure that more women and girls have access to the full range of safe reproductive health services.This progress has made a real difference in the lives of people here in Canada, and around the world. But we know there is much more work to be done to make sure that our country is a place where everyone has a real and fair chance at success.And so we will build on our record  of progress and continue to move forward \u2013 for women, for people of all genders, for Indigenous Peoples, for racialized Canadians, for people with disabilities, for new Canadians, and for members of the LGBTQ2 communities.
